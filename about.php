									We believe that knowledge and teaching are core to achieving the best results at competitions,
									so as a team it is crucial to maintain good documentation of all our processes.
									As information is passed down to newer members, it is important to raise the awareness of robotics 
									for future members of SCR.

									One goal of our organization is to make this learning as effective as possible.
									We believe that each member's learning experience at SCR is not only a positive feedback to the 
									team, but also for the student themselves.

                                    SCR strives to spread the knowledge of STEM and robotics to the surrounding community.
									Introducing pre-college students to robotics and empowering them to
