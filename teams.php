									<p>IGVC, the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, is held in the early summer each year. 
										This competition is all about creating autonomous robots that can navigate a course with lanes and obstacles. 
										IGVC is the most advanced competition we compete in at SCR, requiring strong mechanical, electrical, and software skills. 
										The software team will use many advanced robotics techniques like localization, planning, and computer vision to guide the robot through the lanes and around the obstacles. 
										Our IGVC robot is also our biggest robot we build, so the mechanical and electrical teams must deal with problems such as weight-strength compromises, torque requirements, battery capabilities, and much more.</p>

									<p>Pluto is an annual spring competition held by SCR and OU ourselves, inspired by the Mercury competition. 
										The Pluto competition features robots that must navigiate a defined course while completing one or more tasks (may include picking up objects and transporting them, launching objects, or interacting with a device). 
										The robots are controlled by human operators, but must be controlled remotely. 
										Pluto is the best competition for beginners at SCR, but still has many interesting design considerations. 
										Considerations include designing the mechanisms to complete the required tasks, reducing remote latency to make control easy, and optimizing the robot for manueverability.</p>
